# styling-is-the-sheet
In this refactor project I have cleaned up the html code, consolidated css style element, verified links and fixed broken ones.

In addition, I made sure to add "Error" comments for each image in the webpage along with a number.
The html code has comments regarding each error, in case the user receives an error and reaches out, it will be a smoother process to communicate where they need assistance.

I struggled with making the boxes align at the bottom, despite in depth research online.
